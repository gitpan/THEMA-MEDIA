*sorry for anoying people*

This is a work in progress and already I feel uncomfortable with the whole
CPAN release thing...

The name_'CPAN-foolishness'_ has nothing to do with
the architecture of CPAN or MetaCPAN and my sincere apologies if someone
might have gotten offendend. The _foolishness_ is a mere self-reflection
off all the hassle to go through to do things right.

# About the module

it's a celebration to be back in the game, after two years of sick-leave
to be able to run your own company again. And yes much has changed in
twenty years time. But I still love my old-school green-TTY look-and-feel.

So, I had a great offer to order some printed t-shirts and was going to
order one with my company-logo. Another option was embroidered polo's...
I really like those and then I simply couldn't resist when I saw the dark
green polo's that I could have light green letters on it...

* a company T-polo shirt
* dark green
* light green front that would look like real code
* it should be about Perl
* it needed my company name
* a 9 line mini program that promotes Modern Perl

```perl  
    #!/usr/bin/env perl
    
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    
    use v5.20.1;
    use feature "signatures";
    
    use THEMA::MEDIA;
```
there it was... I only needed a CPAN module now...

I will take orders to make bulk shirts... with another bottom-line,
please contact me for more info.
